# ITP Week 2 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice

# Functions I

#Write a function called use_poke_ball to print the text "You threw a poke ball!" and then call that function.

#Write a function called catch_pokemon that takes a single parameter named favorite, and then prints the words "You caught a " + the name of your favorite pokemon.  Remember to write the function with a single parameter, and then call the function using a string as the arguement.

#Write a SINGLE function defined as catchem_all that runs the TWO function calls you already wrote.  When you run the catchem_all function it should run the TWO functions and print:
#"You threw a poke ball!"
#"You caught a <Ryachu>"

#Let's re-write the catch pokemon function so it's more fun.  Delete the contents of the catch_pokemon function and the function's parameter.  Outside of the catch_pokemon FUNCTION, create a string input and assign it to a variable called pokemon.  For the input question, use the prompt "What did you catch?"  Now let's re-write the print statement, but this time have it print out the pokemon input by the user.
