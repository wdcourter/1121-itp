# COMMENTS

# This is a comment line in python.
# Comments start with a '#' sign and Python will ignore them.
# It can be placed on at the beginning of it's own line or at the end of line as well.
# Comments are used to explain code or (ignored) prevent execution while running/testing code.

# Below is an example of code that is ignored/commented out.
# take_candy_from_baby()

# There is a keyboard shortcut to comment/uncomment code.
# Windows: Ctrl + /
# Mac: Cmd + /
# Now let's prevent the code below from running by commenting it out!
eat_bad_pizza()

# PRINT

# print is a function provided by python.
# It is an output command, which helps verify any content/code
# by displaying it on the terminal.

# We'll go more into functions later but for now,
# there is the function name followed by parentheses ().
# What goes inside of the parentheses are called arguments.

# This particular function takes the argument and "prints" it to the terminal.

# Replace CHANGE_ME to your favorite color and run the code in your terminal.

print("CHANGE_ME")

# Currently what we're printing is just a string.

# STRINGS

# Strings can be written in single or double quotes.
# There is no difference unless you need to nest one in another.

# Example
'He said "What is your name?"'

'hi this line 1'
'this is line 2'
'this is not efficient'

# Instead of creating multiple different string literals for each line,
# there are two ways to create multiple line strings.
# new-line and multi-line

print("this is an example of using \nnewline, which uses backspace")

"""A multi-line uses tripe quotation marks,
which both single or double doesn't matter
as long as they are the same, at the beginning
and end of the string"""

# VARIABLES

# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Variables are created when you ASSIGN a value to them.
# Assignment is done with a SINGLE equal sign (=)

# Unlike other programming languages, it doesnt not require a command for declaring a variable.

my_variable = "a string"

# Rules for variable names
# must start with a letter or the underscore character
# cannot start with a number
# can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# MultiWord Variable Names
# ie. my favorite band
    # 1. MyFavoriteBand - Pascal Case
    # 2. myFavoriteBand - Camel Case
    # 3. my_favorite_band - Snake Case

# Now, instead of printing string literals, we can print variables which store the string!

name = "Danny"

# Change the name above to your name and uncomment the line below!

print(name)

# We can combine like-elements, even as variables. (STRING CONCATENATION)

print("Hello my name is " + name)

# INPUT

# A native python function like print which takes in an argument.
# The argument is a string that acts as a prompt which is printed.
# the function waits for the user input.

# We can take the user input and assign it to a variable.

# Review the hello.py to see an example.

user_age = input("What is your age?")

print("Wow, you look good for " + user_age)
